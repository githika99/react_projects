# WEB102 Prework - Funded Games

Submitted by: **Githika**

**Funded Games** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [ ] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [ ] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [ ] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] I added a log in button to the right of the header. My vision for this website is for users to be able to log in and donate on the website. As a placeholder, this button goes to 'youtube.com'.
* [ ] Each game card includes a donate now button so that users can donate to games of thier choice. Currently, the button goes to 'google.com' as a placeholder. 
* [ ] Each game card also includes a play game button so that users can buy/play the game of their chosing. Currently, the button goes to 'amazon.com' as a placeholder. 
* [ ] I've also added two boxes that say 'Your Donations' and 'Your Games' so that users can see how much they have donated so far and how many games they have contributed to. These boxes have fixed placeholder text of $500 dollars and 3 games, but can be changed if real data were present to draw from.
